The **goal** of this project is **to understand development strategy** for a project. We will practice planning and building project in a structured way:

- backlog
- constraints
- development strategy
- project board

As an example we are using [fake cloud website](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website) created by Brad Traversy.
